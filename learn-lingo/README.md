### Create an application for a company offering to use the services of online language teachers. The application consists of 3 pages:

#### "Home" page with a list of company benefits and a link to start working with the application and redirects to the "Teachers" page. Stylization should be implemented using the examples given in the layout with different variations of the palette, or with the help of a prototype (which will make the "project" more unique).

#### the "Teachers" page, which contains a list of teachers that the user can filter by the language of teaching, by the level of knowledge of the students with whom the teacher works and the price per hour of class.

#### private page "Favorites" with teachers who were added by the user to "favorites"

**Layout**

**Technical task**
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZB_MFgnnJj7t7OXtv5hESSwY6xRgVoACZKzgZczWc3Y/edit?pli=1

1.  With the help of firebase_DB, add the possibility of authorization to the
    application (registration, login, obtaining data about the current user,
    logout).
2.  The form for registration/authorization and minimal validation of its fields
    should be implemented using react-hook-form & yup. All fields are mandatory.
    The modal window with the form should be closed by clicking on the button in
    the form of a "cross", by clicking on the backdrop or pressing the Esc key.
3.  In the Realtime Database (by firebase), create a collection of teachers with
    the following fields: name, surname, languages, levels, rating, reviews,
    price_per_hour, lessons_done, avatar_url, lesson_info, conditions,
    experience You can use teachers.json to populate the collection

    4. According to the layout, implement a card with a description of the
       teacher's characteristics.

4.  4 cards should be rendered on the "Teachers" page, and the rest of them can
    be loaded by clicking on the Load more button, after which a request to the
    database should be executed to display a new batch of cards.
5.  In case of clicking on the button in the form of a "heart": UNAUTHORIZED
    USER - a modal window or push notification should appear stating that this
    functionality is available only to authorized users An authorized user - the
    card must be added to the list of favorites (using localStorage or by
    working with the users - by firebase collection), and the color of the
    "heart" button must be changed.
6.  When the page is updated by an authorized user, the final result of the
    user's actions must be recorded. That is, if you add a card with information
    about the teacher to your favorites and refresh the page, the button still
    remains in the "favorite" state with the appropriate color.
7.  In case of repeated clicking on the button in the form of a "heart", the
    card should be removed from the list of favorites, and the color of the
    button should change to its original state.
8.  If you click on the Read more button, the card should open with more
    detailed information about the teacher and feedback from his students.
9.  If you click on the Book trial lesson button, a modal window should open
    with a form for booking a trial lesson. The form and minimal validation of
    its fields should be implemented using react-hook-form & yup. All fields are
    mandatory.
10. The modal window should be closed by clicking on the button in the form of a
    "cross", by clicking on the backdrop or pressing the Esc key.
11. The private page "Favorites" is available to the authorized user, upon going
    to which the user has the opportunity to view all the cards of teachers that
    he has added to his "favorites". In terms of styling, the page should be
    similar to the "Teachers" page.

**Tasks with an asterisk** Create routing using React Router. Add filtering: by
language of instruction; according to the level of knowledge of students with
whom the teacher works; at the price per hour of class.

### Performance criteria

##### The layout from 320x to 1440x is rubber (must also display correctly on mobile and tablet devices), semantic and valid.

##### No errors in the browser console.

##### The work is done on native JS using a bundler (Vite, Parcel, etc.) or on React.

##### User authorization and working with the collection are implemented using firebase

##### Interactivity works according to the specification.

##### The code is formatted and uncommented.

##### The repository should have a README.md with a description of the project: what this project is about, basic technologies, layout, TK.

##### The project is deployed on github pages, netlify.com or other third-party hosting firebase documentation for working with REST https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference
